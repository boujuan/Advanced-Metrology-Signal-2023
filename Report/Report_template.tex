\section{Introduction}
In this report, we present our analysis of spectral data using MATLAB. We used a spectrograph to collect data and wrote a MATLAB script to process and analyze it. This report outlines our methods, results, and conclusions.

\section{Methods}
Describe the details of the spectrograph and the data collection process. Explain the MATLAB script you wrote to analyze the data, including any libraries or packages you used. Provide the code as an appendix.

\section{Results}
Present the results of your analysis, including any visualizations or plots that you created using MATLAB. Explain what you learned from the analysis.

\section{Conclusions}
Summarize your findings and their implications. Discuss any limitations or shortcomings of your analysis, and suggest future work to improve it.

\section{Appendix}
Include the MATLAB code you wrote to analyze the data.
