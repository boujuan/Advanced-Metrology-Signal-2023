In this document, I present the detailed analysis of data belonging to an emission and absorption spectral signal recorded using prism spectroscopy. This analysis was performed using Matlab. The analysis involves
several steps, beginning with a standard signal analysis to pre-process and clean the data. Then I performed a peak finding algorithm in order to identify the spectral lines. To obtain a better a better estimate of the continuum curve, I removed such peaks from it to create a calibration curve that allowed me to accurately fit a polynomial function and flatten the spectra.
Finally, I fitted Gaussian curves to the different peaks of the spectra in order to determine the element it belongs to, using the NIST database as a reference.

To carry out this analysis, I developed a Matlab tool with an accompanying Python script that fully automates the entire process and provide the necessary visualizations such as plots to aid with the result interpretation.
